# Okada_Slip_Inversion
This is a suite of Matlab routines for using InSAR data to invert for fault slip using Okada solution [(Okada, 1985)](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/75/4/1135/118782/Surface-deformation-due-to-shear-and-tensile).  
The fundamental Okada solution is from **Fran√ßois Beauducel** [okada85.m](https://github.com/IPGP/deformation-lib/tree/master/okada).  I DON'T have any credit of the creation of okada85.m.

The basic workflow is as follows:
